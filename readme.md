Kora AI Unified Intelligence API

Kora AI provides a Unified Intelligence API that acts as a single gateway for developers, traders, and applications to access a fine-tuned AI model (powered by Gemini AI) which has been specifically trained and configured to process data from leading blockchain intelligence platforms including:

Kaito AI (social sentiment & narrative detection)
Arkham Intelligence (wallet forensics, entity mapping, asset tracing)
Dune Analytics (on-chain SQL queries, dashboards, protocol analytics)
DefiLlama (TVL data, protocol rankings, cross-chain liquidity, yield data)

Technical Overview
The API architecture is designed to:

Aggregate, normalize, and route multi-source crypto intelligence data into Koraâ€™s fine-tuned Gemini AI model.
Utilize data connectors, pipelines, and pre-processing agents to clean and format data from APIs like Arkham, Kaito, Dune, and DefiLlama into structured formats consumable by the AI.
Allow users to query using natural language prompts and receive AI-curated outputs combining:

Social narrative detection (Kaito)
Wallet behavior and entity intelligence (Arkham)
On-chain SQL and dashboards (Dune)
TVL, liquidity, and protocol health (DefiLlama)

Key Capabilities
Natural Language Queries: Ask the AI to analyze complex multi-source data with a simple prompt (e.g., "Which DeFi protocols are whales accumulating with rising TVL and positive sentiment?").
Cross-Source Correlation Engine: AI correlates Arkham wallet data, Dune queries, Kaito sentiment, and DefiLlama metrics into unified intelligence reports.
Actionable Signals & Alerts: Developers can integrate the API to trigger alerts, generate dashboards, or feed alpha into their own trading systems or bots.
Plug-and-Play for Developers: Easy integration into existing DeFi apps, terminals, or custom dashboards through a secure API key.

Under the Hood
Fine-Tuned Gemini AI Model: A domain-specific LLM, continuously trained with curated datasets from Kaito, Arkham, Dune, and DefiLlama.
Data Pipelines & Orchestration Layer: Responsible for real-time fetching, transforming, and enriching data before feeding it into the AI model.
Custom AI Agents: Specialized agents within the system (Sentiment Agent, Wallet Intelligence Agent, Protocol Agent) ensure that user queries are routed to the right intelligence layer.
